                    <div class="cell small-12 large-12"><img src="images\sourdough bread.png" alt="bread"></div>
                    <div class="cell small-12 large-12"><p></br>Bread exists in every country around the world. From Indian naan to the French baguette and Venezuelan arepas, bread has been a staple food and fundamental to the structure of societies since before humans even left their nomadic hunter-gatherer lifestyles and settled to establish agricultural communities. Bread has been a symbol of life, culture, civilization, poverty and wealth, and war and peace. 
                    </p></div>

                    <div class="cell small-12 large-12"><p id="life-anchor">In almost every society bread has been a symbol of life. Bread is one of the earliest foods known to have been made by humans. People aren’t able to effectively eat unprocessed grass. The animals that are able to eat grass, like cows and goats, have four stomachs that enable them to ferment every part of the grasses they consume into usable energy. Our single stomach is incapable of this but in learning how to leaven bread, a process which starts this fermentation process before it is even eaten has allowed us the advantages of being able to eat grasses that grow in abundance. Grass occupies around two-thirds of Earth’s landmass and, like every plant, are excellent at absorbing and converting solar energy to the chemical energy all living things are dependent on to continue performing their necessary life processes. Before we were able to convert grass to a form that we were able to eat directly, we had to rely on eating the animals that ate grass or the predators that ate them. Only around 10 percent of energy consumed by animals is passed along when itself is consumed and the rest of the energy is lost. This is why blades of grass are so much more common and available than the largest predators are (Pollan 2013, 218).  As people learned to eat lower on the food chain and higher amounts of solar energy became attainable, populations were able to grow larger. Communities began to settle to grow and develop the grasses with the largest seeds which contained the most energy to both the benefit of the people growing the crops and the grasses as well.

                    <div class="cell small-12 large-6"> </br><p>In ancient Egypt bread was consumed by all members of society, from the Pharaohs to the peasants. Ancient Arabic word for bread is called <i>aish</i> or <i>aish baladi</i>, which also means ‘life’ or ‘livelihoods’ (Barnes 2022, 41). Since bread and beer were the staples of the Egyptian diet and the foundation of all daily meals for both the rich and poor, it was often used as forms of payment to lower class laborers (Brewer 1999). 
                    </p></div>
                    
                    
                    <div class="cell small-12 large-6"> </br><p> Additionally, bread was considered to be a desirable gift to the dead, buried with them in preparation for their journey to the underworld, it was sacrificed to the gods, and the harvesting of grain and the making of bread was often depicted in temple and tomb paintings (Mehdawy 2010, 25). The Egyption god of the dead and afterlife, Osiris, is also associated with resurrection, fertility, and agriculture and by extension, bread. The oldest known references to bread in ancient Egyption mythology is of the goddess Isis, the wife of Osiris, first transforming wheat into bread (Fresco 2016, 87).

                    <div class="cell small-12 large-12"> </br><p>This association with bread and life is consistent in ancient Mesopotamian culture as well. The production and consumption of bread were so integral to the foundations of society. Temples and kings were the main sources of the collection and redistribution of surplus grain as bread was deemed fit for the worship of the gods and for the upkeep of society, for the laborers required to construct and maintain irrigation systems and the army. It is worth noting that there are records of bakers being regarded as a highly respectable profession and exempt from military duty because of how essential the nature of their work was to the community (Waines 1987, 259). “Society was dependent on the goodwill of the gods, ordinary citizens were equally dependent upon the king and his army for their security from external earthly forces; taxes paid for the peace which assured the common man of his daily bread. Simply [bread] was the common denominator in every diet from slaves to the gods…regardless of the individual’s status and rank…bread was seen symbolically as <i>the</i> food, or sustainer, of life and, indeed, of the afterlife as well” (Waines 1987, 260).</p></div>
                    
                    

                    <div class="cell small-12 large-6"><p id="civilization-anchor">In addition to life, bread has been strongly associated with civilization and civilized society. The Mesopotamian <i>Epic of Gilgamesh</i>, refers to Enkidu, the god-created comrade to the Uruk king, as the physical embodiment of the natural world and lives in the wilderness among the animals. It isn’t until he is presented and dines upon bread, “the staff of life”, and wine, “the custom of the land” that he leaves his ‘wild’ and ‘savage’ state as a nomadic hunter-gatherer and becomes a civilized man of society (Fresco 2016, 84). Thus, grains and agriculture are depicted in contrast with man's primitive stage of hunting and gathering (Waines 1987, 257).

                    <div class="cell small-12 large-12"> </br><p>In the Mediterranean, “bread-eaters“ (<i>sitòfagoi</i>), in the language of Homer, is synonymous with “men” (Montanari 2012, 54). To be considered a man, one of the Greeks, the bearers of civilization, it is essential that they eat bread for if they do not then they are “barbarians”. The ability to make bread requires that a society has the means and technology to grow grain, harvest it, mill it into flour, then turn that flour into dough, allow it to rise, and, finally, bake it. This implies that such a society has a long history to allow for the mastery of such techniques (Montanari 2012, 54). Every part of civilized life was in some way tied to grains whether through politics, economy, society, or culture. The extent of one's ability to control plants to produce quality grain determined an individual's wealth and status. The king was in charge of making sure that everyone had regular access to grain to maintain order. During the Crusades bread was used as a symbol of superiority and status of a higher civilization. Christian scholars during the time regarded bread as a mark of identity and saw Arab bread, being unrisen and flat, as undeserving of the title of “bread” and so bread became also “an instrument of cultural conflict” (Montanari 2012, 57).</p></div>



                    <div class="cell small-12 large-6"><p id="control-anchor">Not only has bread been used as a symbol of superiority, but also has been used as a system or means of control. This is a theme prominently reflected in many works of modern literature, in particular in Suzanne Collins’ <i>The Hunger Games</i> where the dystopian city of Panem is in direct reference to the latin phrase <i>panem et circenses</i> or ‘bread and circuses’ where the existence of the hunger games is largely for the purpose of distracting its citizens from the injustice of the elite and powerful. <i>Panem et circenses</i> has been attributed to the Roman poet Juvenal in reference to ‘superficial appeasement’. During the height of the Roman empire, citizens were given free bread and free tickets to the gladiator fights in the Colosseum and chariot races in the Circus Maximus (Aldrete 2021, 4). The emperors understood that to maintain control and avoid political discontentment, those in power must keep the masses fed and preoccupied and keep them grateful to the government instead (Civitello 2011, 48).

                    <div class="cell small-12 large-12"><p id="rebellion-anchor">This is closely related to violence and bread riots, when bread isn’t provided or the prices of bread rise too high for common people to pay, the rebellions and revolts start. There are many times and places that have been the sources of bread riots important to the course of history but “more than any other revolution in history, food played a crucial part in the French Revolution, literally and symbolically (Civitello 2011, 189). Bread was considered a necessary public service to keep the commoners from rioting. As such, police controlled the bakers and every aspect of bread production. If a baker wanted to switch careers they had to get permission from the police first. Every baker was forced to register with the guild and carry a <i>livert</i> or essentially a passport that allowed them to do anything within the country. If they didn’t have one they could be arrested. Additionally, because people assumed that all bakers were selfish and would add wood chips or rotten grain to keep production cheaper, all bakers would have to carve their initials into every loaf of bread they made. An unsigned loaf was illegal (Civitello 2011, 189).

                    <div class="cell small-12 large-6"> <p>The people of France were so reliant on grain and the system could not withstand any disruption caused by crop failures. However, in both summers of 1787 and 1788 crops failed catastrophically leading to higher grain prices and famine. By 1789 little of the stored supply of grain was left and whereas before laborers would spend about 50 percent of their wages on bread, during the height of the famine in 1789 they were spending over 88 percent of their wages so that they could not afford other things like wine or clothing resulting in a economic turndown (Neely 2008, 72). In October of 1789, women went to the market and found that there was no bread and so they marched twelve miles to Versailles. Two years later the king, queen, and their son were dead and one year later the Reign of Terror under Maximilien Robespierre was underway (Civitello 2011, 191).

                    <div class="cell small-12 large-12"><p id="capitalism-anchor">And finally we have come to the industrial revolution and the invention of sliced white bread. White bread was made from refined wheat flour and was seens as a sign of one's status for much of European history as it was expensive and lower classes could only afford to eat oat and rye bread. White wasn’t available to the common person in America until the invention of an automated process to grind and shift the flour by Oliver Evan in 1780 (Voorhees 2004, 111). Sliced bread didn’t become commercially available, however, until 1928. People and stores were first skeptical of sliced bread as cutting bread when it is first made causes it to go stale faster and the bread needs to be wrapped in plastic immediately. In 1930, Wonder Bread was introduced and went national. Though it is not so strange in an age of people who have become “obsessed with streamlined aesthetics of scientific progress and the visual spectacle of purity, hygiene, and progress. The new loaves were also clearly engineered to appear…sparkling clear, whiter than white, and uniformly sliced” (Bobrow-Strain 2008, 31). It became so popular that when it was banned ten years later due to rationing during World War II, households (mainly the women who ran them) were so upset trying to find alternatives and worrying about the time it takes to slice bread themselves that only three months later the ban was lifted and sliced bread was returned to store shelves (Voorhees 2004, 113). </p></div>

                    <div class="cell small-12 large-6"> </br><p>In the process of milling and refining the flour used to make white bread, the vitamins and iron that make bread nutritious are removed. Thus the people who only ate white bread suffered from malnutrition and other related diseases and so state governments then required that these vitamins had to be refortified with the same vitamins and iron (Voorhees 2004, 114) which was then marketed as being a good source of everything your body needs to be strong. This evolution to the bread you can find in supermarkets today reflects America’s desire for cheapness and convenience and, in particular, the white bread that has been a symbol of social status for hundreds of years.</p></div>

                    <div class="cell small-12 large-12"></br><p id="future-anchor">And so, not only has bread been a reflection of what society values but also has been, historically, a symbol of one's status. This remains true today. People who buy artisan bread and whole grain bread from bakeries today (which, objectively, is better bread) believe themselves to be more sophisticated and refined than those people who eat sliced, white bread. During the Covid-19 pandemic as well we saw a return of people trying their own hand at baking home-made bread. </p></div>
